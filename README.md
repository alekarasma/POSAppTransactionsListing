This POS App demonstrates how to display transactions using a Lazy list from Jetpack Compose. It leverages Dependency Injection with Hilt and follows the MVVM pattern with Clean Architecture, ensuring the app is easily scalable and maintainable. Due to the use of these modern architectural practices, the app's functionality can be expanded effortlessly. For instance, you can replace the local repository with a remote repository to fetch the transaction list from a server instead of local storage.
